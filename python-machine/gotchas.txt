gotchas:

initial lookup returning multiple players with same name

e.g.
>>> playerid_lookup('ramírez', 'josé')
  name_last name_first  key_mlbam key_retro  key_bbref  key_fangraphs  mlb_played_first  mlb_played_last
0   ramírez       josé     542432  ramij004  ramirjo02          10171            2014.0           2018.0
1   ramírez       josé     608070  ramij003  ramirjo01          13510            2013.0           2024.0
